## What you accomplished (or attempted) this week:

This week, I collected data from the  Steam API , which involved generating random  Steam User IDs  and handling large-scale data requests. I implemented a  retry strategy  and used  rate limiting  with  time.sleep()  to avoid getting blocked by Steam's API. After data collection, I cleaned the dataset by  removing invalid dates  and  handling missing values . I performed  exploratory data analysis , created  visualizations , and worked on Q1.

---

## Any setbacks/roadblocks you experienced:

I faced challenges during the  data collection process  due to  rate limiting  by the  Steam API , even though the limit is  100,000 requests per day . The server would  stop accepting requests  around  25,000 calls , leading to the need for  manual retries  and  adjusting request intervals  using  time.sleep() . Handling  HTTP request errors  and  server blocks  also required additional  error handling  and  retry strategies.

---

## What you plan to work on next:

I plan to  work on Question 2 . I will also  gather more data  to  expand the dataset .

## Are you on track? If not, how will you get back on track?

So far,  yes , I am on track. However, since I might need  more data , I will also focus on  collecting additional data  this week.
